<h1 id="DevelopmentWorkflow">Development Workflow</h1>
<p>A workflow for developing Qubes OS+</p>
<p>First things first, setup <a href="/wiki/wiki/Qubes">Builder?</a>. This guide assumes you're using qubes-builder to build Qubes.</p>
<h2 id="RepositoriesandCommittingCode">Repositories and Committing Code</h2>
<p>Qubes is split into a bunch of git repos. This are all contained in the <code>qubes-src</code> directory under qubes-builder.</p>
<p>The best way to write and contribute code is to create a git repo somewhere (e.g., github) for the repo you are interested in editing (e.g., <code>qubes-manager</code>, <code>core</code>, etc). To integrate your repo with the rest of Qubes, cd to the repo directory and add your repository as a remote in git</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>$ cd qubes-builder/qubes-src/qubesmanager
$ git remote add abel git@github.com:abeluck/qubes-core.git</code></pre>
<p>You can then proceed to easily develop in your own branches, pull in new commits from the dev branches, merge them, and eventually push to your own repo on github.</p>
<p>When you are ready to submit your changes to Qubes to be merged, push your changes, then create a signed git tag (using <code>git tag -s</code>). Finally, send a letter to the Qubes listserv describing the changes and including the link to your repository. Don't forget to include your public PGP key you use to sign your tags.</p>
