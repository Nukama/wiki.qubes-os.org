VPN connections in Qubes
------------------------

The simplest case if you set up a VPN connection using the Network
Manager inside one of your VMs. Setting up such a connection is really
not Qubes specific and it is documented in Your Operating system
documentation. If you using the Qubes default Guest OS (Fedora):
`â€‹Establishing a VPN
Connection <http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-Establishing_a_VPN_Connection.html>`__

The Qubes specific part is choose the right VM for the VPN client:

NetVM
~~~~~

The simplest case if you set up a VPN connection using the Network
Manager inside your NetVM. Because the
`NetworkManager? </wiki/NetworkManager>`__ already started you are ready
to set up your VPN connection. However this has some disadvantages:

-  You have to place (and probably save) Your VPN credentials inside the
   NetVM wich is directly connected to the outside world
-  All your AppVMs wich are connected to the NetVM will be connected to
   the VPN (by default)

ProxyVM
~~~~~~~

One of the best thing in Qubes that you can use a specian type of VMs
called ProxyVM (or FirewallVM). The special thing is that your AppVMs
see this as a NetVM, and the NetVMs see it as an AppVM. Because of that
You can place a ProxyVM between your AppVMs and Your NetVM. This is how
the default firewall VM is working.

Using a ProxyVM to set up a VPN clinet will gives you the ability to:

-  Separate your VPN credentials from Your AppVM data.
-  You can easily controll wich of your AppVMs are connected to your VPN
   by simply set it as a NetVM of the desired AppVM.

**To setup a ProxyVM as a VPN gateway you should:**

#. create a new VM and check the ProxyVM radiobutton

2. add the network-manager service to this new VM

3. set up Your VPN as described in the Network Manager documentation
   linked above.

4. connect your AppVMs to use the new VM as a NetVM.

AppVM
~~~~~

While the Network Manager is not started here (for a good reason) You
can configure any kind of VPN client in your AppVM as well, however it
is only suggested if you have to use a special VPN clinet.
