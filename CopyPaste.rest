Copy and Paste between domains
==============================

Qubes fully supports secure copy and paste operation between domains. In
order to copy a clipboard from domain A to domain B, follow those steps:

#. Click on the application window in the domain A where you have
   selected text for copying. Then use the *app-specific* hot-key (or
   menu option) to copy this into domain's local clipboard (in other
   words: do the copy operation as usual, in most cases by pressing
   Ctrl-C).
#. Then (when the app in domain A is still in focus) press Ctrl-Shift-C
   magic hot-key. This will tell Qubes that we want to select this
   domain's clipboard for *global copy* between domains.
#. Now select the destination app, running in domain B, and press
   Ctrl-Shift-V, another magic hot-key that will tell Qubes to make the
   clipboard marked in the previous step available to apps running in
   domain B. This step is necessary because it ensures that only domain
   B will get access to the clipboard copied from domain A, and not any
   other domain that might be running in the system.
#. Now, in the destination app use the app-specific key combination
   (usually Ctrl-V) for pasting the clipboard.

Note that the global clipboard will be cleared after step #3, to prevent
accidental leakage to another domain, if the user accidentally pressed
Ctrl-Shift-V later.

This 4-step process might look complex, but after some little practice
it really is very easy and fast. At the same time it provides the user
with full control over who has access to the clipboard.

Note that only simple plain text copy/paste is supported between AppVMs.

On Copy/Paste Security
----------------------

The scheme is *secure* because it doesn't allow other VMs to steal the
content of the clipboard. However, one should keep in mind that
performing a copy and paste operation from *less trusted* to *more
trusted* domain can always be potentially insecure, because the data
that we insert might potentially try to exploit some hypothetical bug in
the destination VM (e.g. the seemingly innocent link that we copy from
untrusted domain, might turn out to be, in fact, a large buffer of junk
that, when pasted into the destination VM's word processor could exploit
a hypothetical bug in the undo buffer). This is a general problem and
applies to any data transfer between *less trusted to more trusted*
domain. It even applies to copying files between physically separate
machines (air-gapped) systems. So, you should always copy clipboard and
data only from *more trusted* to *less trusted* domains.
