Using Disposable VMs
====================

Background
----------

See `â€‹this
article <http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/06/disposable-vms.html>`__
for a background on why would one want to use a Disposable VM and what
it is.

Opening a file in a Disposable VM (via GUI)
-------------------------------------------

In some AppVM, right click on the file you wish to open in a Disposable
VM (in the Nautilus file manager), then choose Scripts -> Open in
Disposable VM. Wait a few seconds and an default application for this
file type should appear displaying the file content. This app is running
in a whole new VM -- a disposable VM created for the purpose of view
this very file. Once you close the viewing application then whole
Disposable VM will get destroyed.

Opening a fresh web browser instance in a new Disposable VM
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to open a fresh instance of Firefox within a
new fresh Disposable VM. This can be easily done by using the Start
Menu: just go to Start -> Disposable VM -> Firefox and wait a few
seconds until a web browser starts. Once you close the viewing
application then whole Disposable VM will get destroyed.

Opening a file in a Disposable VM via command line (from AppVM)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Use the ``qvm-open-in-dvm`` command line (from your AppVM), e.g.:

.. code:: wiki

    [user@work-pub ~]$ qvm-open-in-dvm Downloads/apple-sandbox.pdf

The qvm-open-in-dvm will not exit until you close the application in the
Disposable VM.

Starting an arbitrary application in a disposable VM via command line (from Dom0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** Normally there should be no need for doing this -- this is
just for Qubes hackers ;)

.. code:: wiki

    [joanna@dom0 applications]$ echo gnome-terminal | /usr/lib/qubes/qfile-daemon-dvm qubes.VMShell dom0 DEFAULT red

In fact the Disposable VM appmenu used for starting Firefox contains a
very similar command to the above. Please note, however, that it
generally makes little sense to start any other application other than a
Web Browser this way...

Using a non-default template as a basis for Disposable VM
---------------------------------------------------------

In some situations it might be beneficial to use a non-default template
as a basis for Disposable VM. One example is to use a less-trusted
template with some less trusted, 3rd party, often unsigned, applications
installed, such as e.g. 3rd part printer drivers.

In order to regenerate Disposable VM "snapshot" (called 'savefile' on
Qubes) one can conveniently use the following command in Dom0:

.. code:: wiki

    [joanna@dom0 ~]$ qvm-create-default-dvm <custom-template-name>

This would create a new Disposable VM savefile based on the custom
template. Now, whenever one opens a file (from any AppVM) in a
Disposable VM, a Disposable VM based on this template will be used.
