Using Disposable VMs
====================

Background
----------

See `â€‹this
article <http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/06/disposable-vms.html>`__
for a background on why would one want to use a Disposable VM and what
it is.

Opening a file in a Disposable VM (via GUI)
-------------------------------------------

In some AppVM, right click on the file you wish to open in a Disposable
VM (in the Nautilus file manager), then choose Scripts -> Open in
Disposable VM. Wait a few seconds and an default application for this
file type should appear displaying the file content. This app is running
in a whole new VM -- a disposable VM created for the purpose of view
this very file. Once you close the viewing application then whole
Disposable VM will get destroyed.

Opening a fresh web browser instance in a new Disposable VM
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to open a fresh instance of Firefox within a
new fresh Disposable VM. This can be easily done by using the Start
Menu: just go to Start -> Disposable VM -> Firefox and wait a few
seconds until a web browser starts. Once you close the viewing
application then whole Disposable VM will get destroyed.
