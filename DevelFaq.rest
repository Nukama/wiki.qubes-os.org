Qubes Developers FAQ
====================

Q: Why does dom0 need to be 64-bit?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often it is more difficult to exploit a bug on the x64 Linux than it is
on x86 Linux (e.g. ASLR is sometimes harder to get around). While we
designed Qubes with the emphasis on limiting any potential attack
vectors in the first place, still we realize that some of the code
running in Dom0, e.g. our GUI daemon or xen-store daemon, even though it
is very simple code, might contain some bugs. Plus currently we haven't
implemented a separate storage domain (which is planned only for Release
2), so also the disk backends are in Dom0 and are "reachable" from the
VMs, which adds up to the potential attack surface. So, having faced a
choice between 32-bit and 64-bit OS for Dom0, it was almost a
no-brainer, as the 64-bit option provides some (little perhaps, but
still) more protection against some classes of attacks, and at the same
time do not have any disadvantages (except that it requires a 64-bit
processor, but all systems on which it makes sense to run Qubes, e.g.
that have at least 3-4GB memory, they do have 64-bit CPUs anyway).

Q: Why do you use KDE in Dom0? What is the roadmap for Gnome support?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are very few things that are KDE-specific and thus it should not
be a big problem to port add Gnome support to Qubes (in Dom0 of course).
Those KDE-specific things are:

-  Qubes requires KDM (KDE Login Manager), rather than GDM, for the very
   simple reason that GDM doesn't obey standards and start
   ````\ ``/usr/bin/Xorg``\ ```` instead of ````\ ``/usr/bin/X``\ ````.
   This is important for Qubes, because we need to load a special "X
   wrapper" (to make it possible to use Linux usermode shared memory to
   access Xen shared memory pages in our App Viewers -- see the sources
   `â€‹here <http://qubes-os.org/gitweb/?p=mainstream/gui.git;a=tree;f=shmoverride;h=75133ddcdad0c6a59e630f005569bb8c758b67c5;hb=HEAD>`__).
   So, Qubes makes the ````\ ``/usr/bin/X``\ ```` to be a symlink to the
   Qubes X Wrapper, which, in turn, executes the
   ````\ ``/usr/bin/Xorg``\ ````. This works well with KDM (and would
   probably also work with other X login managers), but not with GDM. If
   somebody succeeded in makeing GDM to execute
   ````\ ``/usr/bin/X``\ ```` instead of ````\ ``/usr/bin/Xorg``\ ````,
   we would love to hear about it!

-  We're planning to patch the KDE's Window Manager (KWin) to draw
   window decorations in the color of the specific AppVM's label.
   Currently we draw frames in the `AppViewers? </wiki/AppViewers>`__,
   but it would be a better user experience to also see the title bars
   having the color of the VM's label. Most likely this should also be
   possible to be done on GNOME's Window Manager too, but as we have
   very litmited resources, we are forced to pick only one Window
   Manager, and we decided to pick KDE (just because we like it). If
   somebody were willing to send the code for GNOME, we would be more
   that happy to incorporate it into mainstream repo.
