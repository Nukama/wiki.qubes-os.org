<p>This requires qubes-core-appvm-1.0.1 of higher.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert your USB stick.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>In Dom0 konsole (running as normal user) do:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="wiki"><code>xl block-attach &lt;vmname&gt; phy:/dev/sdb1 /dev/xvdi w</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that your stick is seen by Dom0 kernel as <strong>/dev/sdb</strong> and you're mounting its first partition, so <strong>/dev/sdb1</strong> (the usual case).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Open Nautilus file manager in the AppVM. Your stick should be visible in the &quot;Places&quot; panel on the left. Just click on the device.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you finish using your USB stick, right-click its icon in Dolphin and chose &quot;Safely Remove &lt;Your stick name&gt;&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Back to Dom0 konsole -- in order to unmount the stick do the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="wiki"><code>xl block-detach &lt;vmname&gt; /dev/xvdi</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>You can remove the device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, we will be adding support for USB mounting to our GUI Qubes Manager so that the user will not need to use console in Dom0 -- just click a button. Coming soon, stay tuned!</p>
