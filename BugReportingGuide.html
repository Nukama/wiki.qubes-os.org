<h1 id="BugReportingGuide">Bug Reporting Guide</h1>
<p>One of the most important contribution task is reporting the bugs you have found.</p>
<p>All bugs and suggestions should be reported to one of our <a href="/wiki/wiki/QubesLists">mailing list</a>. We decided that at this stage access to the wiki and the <a href="https://qubes-os.org/trac/report/3">​ticketing system</a> should be limited and per-invitation only, and generally granted to those people who actually can first demonstrate that they are capable of contributing something useful to the project. Our main goal is to build a quality product, and this has a priority over building &quot;a large community&quot;.</p>
<p>So if you have not allowed to file new tickets You should follow these guide lines:</p>
