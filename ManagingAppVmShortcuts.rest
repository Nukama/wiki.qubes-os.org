Managing shortcuts to applications in AppVMs
============================================

For ease of use Qubes aggregates shortcuts to applications that are
installed in AppVMs and shows them in one "start menu" in dom0. Clicking
on such shortcut runs the assigned application in its AppVM.

To make newly installed applications show up in the menu, use the
**qvm-sync-appmenus** command:

``qvm-sync-appmenus vmname``

After that, select the *Add more shortcuts* entry in VM's submenu to
customize which applications are shown:

The above image shows that Windows HVMs are also supported (provided
that Qubes Tools are installed).

Behind the scenes
-----------------

List of installed applications for each AppVM is stored in
``/var/lib/qubes/appvms/vmname/apps.templates``. Each menu entry is a
file that follows the `â€‹.desktop file
format <http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html>`__
with some wildcards (*%VMNAME%*, *%VMDIR%*). Applications selected to
appear in the menu are stored in ``/var/lib/qubes/appvms/vmname/apps``.

Actual command lines for the menu shortcuts involve ``qvm-run`` command
which starts a process in another domain. Example:
``qvm-run -q --tray -a w7s 'cmd.exe /c "C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Accessories\\Calculator.lnk"'``

``qvm-sync-appmenus`` works by invoking *GetAppMenus* `Qubes
service </wiki/Qrexec>`__ in the target domain. This service enumerates
installed applications and sends formatted info back to the dom0 script
which creates .desktop files in the AppVM directory.

For Linux VMs the service script is in
``/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.GetAppMenus``. In Windows it's a PowerShell
script located in
``c:\Program Files\Invisible Things Lab\Qubes OS Windows Tools\qubes-rpc-services\get-appmenus.ps1``
by default.
