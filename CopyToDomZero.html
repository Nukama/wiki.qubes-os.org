<h2 id="CopyingfilestobetweenVMsandDom0">Copying files to between VMs and Dom0</h2>
<p>First, there should normally be few reasons for the user to want to copy files from VMs to Dom0, as Dom0 only acts as a &quot;thin trusted terminal&quot;, and no user applications run there. However, one exception to this is if we want to copy a desktop wallpaper, that we normally have in one of the AppVMs (e.g. in the 'personal' AppVM where we got it from our camera, or downloaded from the Internet). While it's a well justified reason, one should remember, however, that copying untrusted files to Dom0 might be a fatal security problem. Imagine what would happen if the wallpaper (e.g. a JPEG file) was somehow malformed and was in fact attempting to exploit a hypothetical JPEG parser bug in Dom0 code (e.g. in the Dom0's Xorg/KDE component that parses the wallpaper and displays it).</p>
<p>For this reason we intentionally do not provide a convenient tool for copying files between VMs and Dom0 (while we provide a tool for copying files between VMs). However, if you're determined to copy some files to Dom0 anyway, you can use the following method (run this command from Dom0's console):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>qvm-run --pass-io &lt;src_domain&gt; &#39;cat /path/to/file_in_src_domain&#39; &gt; /path/to/file_name_in_dom0</code></pre>
<p>BTW, you can use the same method to copy files from Dom0 to VMs:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>cat /path/to/file_in_dom0 | qvm-run --pass-io &lt;dst_domain&gt; &#39;cat &gt; /path/to/file_name_in_appvm&#39;</code></pre>
<h3 id="Copyinglogsfromdom0">Copying logs from dom0</h3>
<p>In order to easily copy/paste the contents of logs from dom0 to the inter-VM clipboard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the desired VM in the Qubes VM Manager.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Logs.&quot;</li>
<li>Click on the desired log.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Copy to Qubes clipboard.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>You may now paste the log contents to any VM as you normally would (i.e., Ctrl-Shift-V, then Ctrl-V).</p>
