In order to assign a whole PCI/e device to a VM one should use
````\ ``qvm-pci``\ ```` tool. E.g.

.. code:: wiki

    lspci

Find the BDF address of the device you want to assign, and then:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-pci -a <vmname> <bdf>

E.g. assuming 00:1a.0 is a BDF of the device I want to assign to
"personal" domain:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-pci -a personal 00:1a.0

Note that one can only assign full PCI or PCI Express devices. This
means one cannot assign single USB devices -- only the whole USB
controller with whatever USB devices connected to it. This limit is
imposed by PC and VT-d architecture.

Possible issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VM with PCI device in Qubes have allocated small buffer for DMA
operations (called swiotlb). By default it is 2MB, but some devices
needs a larger space. To change this allocation, edit VM kernel
parameters (this is expressed in 512B chunks):

.. code:: wiki

    # qvm-prefs netvm |grep kernelopts
    kernelopts       : iommu=soft swiotlb=2048 (default)
    # qvm-prefs -s netvm kernelopts "iommu=soft swiotlb=4096"
