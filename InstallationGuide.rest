Installation Guide (for Qubes Beta 1)
=====================================

**Qubes Beta 1 is scheduled to be released on April 12th! Stay tuned!**

Our servers longer support installation of Alpha 3.

**The instructions below are just a draft -- do not try to follow them
now!**

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Minimum:

-  4GB of RAM
-  64-bit Intel or AMD processor (x86\_64 aka x64 aka AMD64)
-  Intel GPU strongly preferred (if you have Nvidia GPU, prepare for
   some `troubleshooting </wiki/InstallNvidiaDriver>`__; we haven't
   tested ATI hardware)
-  10GB of disk (Note that **it is possible to install Qubes on an
   external USB disk**, so that you can try it without sacrificing your
   current system. Mind, however that USB disks are usually SLOW!)

Additional requirements:

-  Intel VT-d or AMD IOMMU technology (this is needed for effective
   isolation of your network VMs)

If you don't meet the additional criteria, you can still install and use
Qubes. It still offers significant security improvement over traditional
OSes, because things such as GUI isolation, or kernel protection do not
require special hardware.

Download installer ISO
----------------------

You can download the ISO and the digital signature for the ISO from
here:

-  TODO (ISO link)
-  TODO (ISO sig link)

See this `page </wiki/VerifyingSignatures>`__ for more info about how to
download and verify our GPG keys. Then, verify the downloaded ISO:

.. code:: wiki

    gpg -v ISO.asc

Once you verify this is an authentic ISO, you should burn it on a DVD.
For instructions on how to "burn" it on a USB stick, see `this
page </wiki/UsbInstallation>`__. Before proceeding with the
installation, you are encouraged to first read all the information on
this page, especially the *Known Issues* paragraph.

Then, when finally ready, boot your system from the installer DVD and
follow the instructions on screen. The installer is very simple and asks
very few questions -- it's actually easier to install Qubes right now,
then most other Linux distributions!

The installer loads Xen right at the beginning, so chances are high that
if you can see the installer's graphical screen, Qubes will work on your
system :)

Migrating from Qubes Alpha 3
----------------------------

If you have Qubes Alpha 3 currently installed you must reinstall from
scratch, as we offer no direct upgrade option in the installer. However,
we do offer tools for smooth migration of your AppVMs. In order to do
that, please backup your AppVMs using the ````\ ``qvm-backup``\ ````
tool [BackupRestore: as usual] (under Qubes Alpha 3). Then, after you
install Qubes Beta 1, you will need to restore them using a special
argument that would tell the restore tool to replace the old template
name, used on Alpha 3, with the new one that we use on Qubes Beta 1:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-backup-restore /mnt/backup/<backup_dir> --replace-template=linux-x64:fedora-14-x64

As you can see we decided to name our default template in Beta 1 in a
bit more descriptive way (*fedora-14-x64*), mostly because we might be
providing more templates in the future (e.g. based on other Linux
distros).

Enable VT-d/IOMMU
-----------------

In order to take advantage of NetVM isolation you should enable
VT-d/IOMMU (if your system supports it). To do that you should add
````\ ``iommu=1``\ ```` boot option to Xen by editing your
````\ ``grub.conf``\ ```` file. This can be done in the following way:

#. Open konsole in Dom0 (Start->Applications->System Tools->Terminal)
#. Working now under console, switch to root first:

   .. code:: wiki

       sudo bash

#. Use your favourite editor such as vi or joe to open the
   /boot/grub/grub.conf and add **````\ ``iommu=1``\ ````** just after
   the ````\ ``/xen.gz``\ ```` string as shown in the example below
   (some fragments of the file omitted for clarity):

   .. code:: wiki

       title Qubes (2.6.34.1-14.xenlinux.qubes.x86_64)
           root (hd0,0)
           kernel /xen.gz iommu=1
           module /vmlinuz-2.6.34.1-14.xenlinux.qubes.x86_64 (...)
           module /initramfs-2.6.34.1-14.xenlinux.qubes.x86_64.img

You should now reboot your system and examine Xen logs to see if VT-d
has indeed been enabled (Xen can fail to enable VT-d on your system for
various of reasons, lack of proper BIOS support being the most common
one). To do that just grep the Xen system log for iommu and vtd strings
(you need to open konsole in Dom0 again):

.. code:: wiki

    xm dmesg | grep -i iommu
    xm dmesg | grep -i vtd

Yes, we will make this procedure more user friendly in the next Beta :)

Known Issues
------------

-  NVIDIA GPU will likely cause problems, especially if you use
   suspend-to-RAM. This mostly results from the general poor support for
   NVIDIA GPUs under Linux, which in turn is caused by the lack of open
   documentation for those GPUs. You might try to use the NVIDIA's
   proprietary driver (see the instructions
   `here </wiki/InstallNvidiaDriver>`__), which apparently helps a lot.
-  If you have Sony Vaio Z, you will need some tinkering before you
   would be able to fully use this machine with Qubes (and generally
   with non-Windows systems). See this
   `page </wiki/SonyVaioTinkering>`__ for instructions.
-  KDE taskbar might look ugly. This problem can be easily solved by
   turning composition on (it's called "Desktop Effects", and can be
   found in System `Settings/Desktop? </wiki/Settings/Desktop>`__ tab).
-  Currently there is no support for delegating single USB devices to
   NetVMs, which likely mean that you will not be able to use your 3G
   modem. The only option is to delegate the whole USB controller to a
   NetVM, which, however, might not always be desirable, because of the
   other devices that are connected to this USB controller.
-  KDE might break after resume from suspend-to-RAM -- this is a
   KDE-specific bug and applies to some GPUs only. The solution is to
   switch off composition (normally Alt-Shift-F12) before putting the
   computer into sleep.
-  It might take up to 1 minute after you log in for the NetVM's network
   icon to appear in the tray -- be patient!
