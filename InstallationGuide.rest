Installation Guide (for Qubes 1.0)
==================================

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Please see the `Hardware Compatibility List </wiki/HCL>`__ page for more
information on required and recommended hardware.

Download installer ISO
----------------------

You can download the ISO and the digital signature for the ISO from
here:

**Note:** Be sure that you use a modern, non-handicapped browser to
access the links below (e.g. disable the NoScript and the likes
extensions that try to turn your Web Browser essentially into the 90's
Mosaic).

-  `​http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86\_64-DVD.iso <http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86_64-DVD.iso>`__
-  `​http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86\_64-DVD.iso.asc <http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86_64-DVD.iso.asc>`__

... or you might try to download the ISO via bit torrent:

-  `​http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86\_64-DVD.iso?torrent <http://qubes-os.s3.amazonaws.com/iso/Qubes-R1-x86_64-DVD.iso?torrent>`__

See this `page </wiki/VerifyingSignatures>`__ for more info about how to
download and verify our GPG keys. Then, verify the downloaded ISO:

.. code:: wiki

    gpg -v <iso>.asc

Burning the ISO onto a DVD or USB stick
---------------------------------------

Once you verify this is an authentic ISO, you should burn it on a DVD.

If you prefer to use USB as a source for installation, then you just
need to copy the ISO onto the USB device, e.g. using dd:

.. code:: wiki

    dd if=Qubes-R1-rc1-x86_64-DVD.iso of=/dev/sdX

**Be sure to use a correct device as the target in the dd command above
(instead of sdX)'''**

Before proceeding with the installation, you are encouraged to first
read all the information on this page, especially the *Known Issues*
paragraph.

Then, when finally ready, boot your system from the installer DVD and
follow the instructions on screen. The installer is very simple and asks
very few questions -- it's actually easier to install Qubes right now
than most other Linux distributions!

The installer loads Xen right at the beginning, so chances are high that
if you can see the installer's graphical screen, Qubes will work on your
system :)

Upgrading from Qubes 1.0-rc1
----------------------------

If you're already running Qubes 1.0-rc1, you don't need to reinstall,
it's just enough to update the packages in your Dom0 and the template
VM(s). The easiest way for doing this is to click on the Update Button
in the Qubes Manger -- one click when you selected Dom0, and one click
for each of your template VM (by default there is just one template).

Migrating from Qubes Beta 3
---------------------------

If you have Qubes Beta 3 currently installed on your system, you must
reinstall from scratch, as we offer no direct upgrade option in the
installer (sorry). However, we do offer tools for smooth migration of
your AppVMs. In order to do that, please backup your AppVMs using the
````\ ``qvm-backup``\ ```` tool `as usual </wiki/BackupRestore>`__.
Then, after you install Qubes 1.0 rc1, you can restore them using
````\ ``qvm-backup-restore``\ ```` tool. However, because we have
changed the default template in RC1, you should tell qvm-back-restore
about that by passing ````\ ``--replace-template``\ ```` option:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-backup-restore <backup_dir> --replace-template=fedora-15-x64:fedora-17-x64 

Installing Updates
------------------

Installing updates is very easy and can be done using the "Update"
button in the Qubes Manager. Alternatively it can also be done from
command prompt -- see the following for more details:

-  For installing updates for Dom0 -- see instructions
   `here </wiki/SoftwareUpdateDom0>`__.
-  For installing updates for you domains (VMs) -- see instructions
   `here </wiki/SoftwareUpdateVM>`__.

Known Issues
------------

-  Installer might not support some USB keyboards (#230). This seems to
   include all the Mac Book keyboards (most PC laptops have PS2
   keyboards and are not affected).

-  If you don't enable Composition (System Setting -> Desktop -> Enable
   desktop effects), which you really should do, then the KDE task bar
   might get somehow ugly (e.g. half of it might be black). This is some
   KDE bug that we don't plan to fix.

-  Some keyboard layout set by KDE System Settings can cause `​keyboard
   not working at
   all <https://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel/browse_thread/thread/77d076b65dda7226>`__.
   If you hit this issue, you can switch to console (by console login
   option) and manually edit
   ````/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-system-setup-keyboard.conf\ ```` (and
   ````/etc/sysconfig/keyboard````) and place correct keyboard layout
   settings (details in linked thread). You can check if specific
   keyboard layout settings are proper using ````\ setxkbmap\ ```` tool.

Getting Help
------------

-  **User manuals are `here </wiki/UserDoc>`__.** (Strongly
   recommended!)

-  Developers documentation (normally not needed by users) is
   `here </wiki/SystemDoc>`__

-  If you don't find answer in the sources given above, write to the
