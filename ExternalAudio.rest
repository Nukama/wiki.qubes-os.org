Using External Audio Devices
============================

Why you want to use external audio devices
------------------------------------------

Qubes audio virtualization protocol does not implement latency reporting
for security reasons, keeping the protocol as simple as possible. Also,
in a compromise between low latency and low CPU usage, latency may be
around 200 ms. So applications demanding higher audio quality need a
better environment. But Qubes flexibility fully allows that using
external audio devices. These are mostly USB audio cards, but firewire
devices also might be used.

Implementing external audio devices
-----------------------------------

First you need to identify an user VM dedicated to audio and `â€‹assign a
device <https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/AssigningDevices>`__ to it. In
the most common case the assigned device is the USB controller to which
the USB audio card will be connected.

Fedora VMs
~~~~~~~~~~

In a terminal of the template from which you user VM depends, install
pavucontrol with:

.. code:: wiki

    sudo yum install pavucontrol

Close the template and start or restart your user VM, insert your
external audio, open a terminal and prepare pulseaudio to use it with:

.. code:: wiki

    sudo chmod a+rw /dev/snd/*
    pactl load-module module-udev-detect

Start the audio application that is going to use the external audio
device.

Launch pavucontrol, for example using "run command in VM" of Qubes
Manager and select you external audio card in pavucontrol. You need to
do that only the first time you use a new external audio device, then
pulse audio will remember you selection.
