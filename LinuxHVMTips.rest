Tips for Linux in HVM domain
============================

Screen resolution
-----------------

Some kernel/Xorg combination use only 640x480 in HVM, which is quite
small. To enable maximum resolution, some changes in Xorg configuration
are needed:

#. Force "vesa" video driver
#. Provide wide horizontal synchronization range

To achieve it (all commands run as root):

#. Generate XOrg configuratio (if you don't have it):

   .. code:: wiki

       X -configure :1 && mv ~/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf

#. Add `HorizSync? </wiki/HorizSync>`__ line to Monitor section, it
   should look something like:

   .. code:: wiki

       Section "Monitor"
               Identifier   "Monitor0"
               VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
               ModelName    "Monitor Model"
               HorizSync    30.0 - 60.0
       EndSection

#. Change driver to "vesa" in Device section:

   .. code:: wiki

       Section "Device"
               # (...)
               Identifier  "Card0"
               Driver      "vesa"
               VendorName  "Technical Corp."
               BoardName   "Unknown Board"
               BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
       EndSection

Now you should get at least 1280x1024 and be able to choose other modes.

Qubes agents
------------

Linux Qubes agents are written with PV domain in mind, but it looks to
be possible to run them also in HVM domain. However some work is
required to achieve it. Check `â€‹this
