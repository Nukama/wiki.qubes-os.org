Q: Can I install Qubes on a system without VT-d?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes you can. You can even run a netvm but, of course, you will not
benefit from DMA protection for driver domains. So, on a system without
VT-d, everything should work the same, but there is no real security
benefit of having a separate netvm, as the attacker can always use a
simple DMA attack to go from netvm to Dom0.

The above is in theory -- in practice, if you have a broken network card
driver and try to run it in a netvm on a system without VT-d, it might
crash your system. This might happen e.g. if the driver is not properly
using DMA-API.
