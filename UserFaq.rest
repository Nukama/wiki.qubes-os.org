Qubes User's FAQ
================

Q: How much memory is recommended for Qubes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4 GB at least. Sure, you can try it on a system with 2GB, but don't
expect to be able to run more than 3 AppVMs at the same time.

Q: Can I install Qubes on a system without VT-x?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Xen doesn't use VT-x (nor AMD-v) for PV guests virtualization (it
uses ring0/3 separation instead). But, of course, without VT-x, you will
also not have VT-d -- see the next question.

Q: Can I install Qubes on a system without VT-d?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes you can. You can even run a netvm but, of course, you will not
benefit from DMA protection for driver domains. So, on a system without
VT-d, everything should work the same, but there is no real security
benefit of having a separate netvm, as the attacker can always use a
simple DMA attack to go from netvm to Dom0.

The above is in theory -- in practice, if you have a broken network card
driver and try to run it in a netvm on a system without VT-d, it might
crash your system. This might happen e.g. if the driver is not properly
using DMA-API.

Q: Can I use AMD-v instead of VT-x?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Can I install Qubes in a Virtual Machine, e.g. on VMWare?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most likely no. You should install it on bare-metal. Hey, it uses its
own bare-metal hypervisor, after all...

Q: Why is Fedora 12 "strongly" recommended as dom0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As currently Qubes do not have its own installer, we need to rely on
some other Linux distribution to bring all the software needed in Dom0.
We made a more-or-less arbitrary decision to choose Fedora 12 as a base
for our Dom0 and we have prepared all the RPMs and tested them with the
assumption that the user has installed Dom0 based on F12 according to
the specific instructions we gave in the `Installation
Guide </wiki/InstallationGuide>`__. Qubes would most likely run on other
RPM-based Linux distributions, although we have never tested it, and
we'd rather focus our resources on implementing other Qubes features,
than on testing other distros for Dom0 support. Especially that we plan
to write custom installer for Qubes anyway -- see the next question.

Q: Do you plan to "port" Qubes to other Linux distros?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Absolutely no. The plan for the near future (see the
`​Roadmap <https://www.qubes-os.org/trac/roadmap>`__) is to create a
custom (and very simple to use) Qubes installer that would automatically
take care about installing the minimal Dom0 system, all the Qubes
packages in Dom0, and also the Qubes template and service VMs images. In
other words Qubes will evolve into a true standalone system, not based
on any specific Linux distribution (well, we still will probably use
Fedora RPMs for most of the packages and probably the Anaconda
installer, but this will be hidden from the user).

Q: What is the recommended way update the template VM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shutdown all the running AppVMs that are based on this template
(normally all your AppVMs are based on the same template):

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-run --shutdown --wait --all --exclude netvm

(In the comming weeks we will provide a graphical VM manager where you
will be able to do the above with just one or two mouse clicks :)

Next, start either console, e.g. Konsole, or KPackageKit application in
your Template VM (normally it's called "linux-x64"), using the KDE menu,
and proceed with the updates. If you use console then you will want to
use yum (you must switch to root), e.g.:

.. code:: wiki

    yum update

If you chose KPackageKit, then you should be able to update using just
your mouse.

Once the Template VM got update, shut it down, and then any AppVM you
start will already be using update software.

Q: What is the root and user password for TemplateVM/AppVM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is none, really! If you need to run something as root in one of
your VMs, then you should use the qvm-run command:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-run <vmname> -u root <cmd>

where cmd can be e.g. ````\ ``konsole``\ ````.

Q: Is Qubes a multi-user system?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, Qubes does not pretend to be a multi-user system. Qubes assumes that
the user that controls Dom0, controls the whole system. It will be very
difficult to **securely** implement multi-user support -- see this
message:

`​https://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel/msg/899f6f3efc4d9a06 <https://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel/msg/899f6f3efc4d9a06>`__

Q: Do you plan to distribute Qubes as an "addon" to other Linux distros?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. In order to really built a secure OS, we need to control the whole
system, e.g. what packages are installed in Dom0, how is network
configured there (i.e. that there will be \*no\* networking there), etc.
The best way to achieve this is to have a standalone OS (or distro as
you call it), not an add-on to some other distro.

Q: But wouldn't it be cool to use some hardened distro as Dom0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main idea behind Qubes architecture is to have Dom0 isolated from
the outside world, so there is little point in further hardening it via
e.g. grsecurity, etc.

Q: Perhaps it would make sense then to have a template VM based on some hardened distro?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yup, that would make sense indeed. Feel free to build one -- you can use
the template\_builder:

`​http://qubes-os.org/gitweb/?p=mainstream/template-builder.git;a=tree <http://qubes-os.org/gitweb/?p=mainstream/template-builder.git;a=tree>`__

Q: Sometimes it takes a long time for Qubes to boot, why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is likely because Qubes re-creates a Disposable VM savefile -- an
image used for super quick starting of Disposable VMs. Normally this
happens when you update your default template, and takes about 2
minutes. You can hit ESC during boot to see the progress information.
