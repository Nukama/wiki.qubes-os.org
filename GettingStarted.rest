Getting Started with Qubes OS
=============================

So, you just installed a fresh Qubes OS, huh? Let's see what your next
steps could be...

What are AppVMs (domains) and Template VMs?
-------------------------------------------

In Qubes you run all your programs in **domains**, also called
**AppVMs**, because those domains are implemented as lightweight Virtual
Machines (VMs). It's not true that every app runs in its own VM -- that
would be a big waste of resources. Instead the VMs represent security
domains, such as: *work*, *personal*, *banking*, etc. Each domain is
based, by default, on a common **Template VM**, which means that
whenever you create a new domain you don't copy the whole root
filesystem needed for this AppVM to work (such as all the programs, etc)
-- instead each AppVM shares the root filesystem with the template VM.
Of course each AppVM has only read-only access to the Template VM's
filesystem, so cannot modify it in any way. This means that creating
many domains is cheap -- they need disk space only to hold your private
files (such as the home folder).

If you have proceeded with the default installation options, Qubes has
already pre-created a few domains for you:

-  work
-  personal
-  banking
-  untrusted

Each domain, apart from having a distinct name, is also assigned a
**label**, which basically is one of the several per-defined colors.
These colors, which are used for drawing window decorations by the
trusted Window Manager (color frames), are supposed to be user friendly,
easy noticeable, indicators of how trusted a given window is. It's
totally up to the user how he or she interprets these colors. For me, it
has been somehow obvious to associate the red color with something that
is untrusted and dangerous (the “red light” -- stop! danger!), green
with something that is safe and trusted, while yellow and orange with
something in the middle. I have also extended this scheme, to also
include blue, and black, which I interpret as indicating progressively
more trusted domains than green, with black being something ultimately
trusted.

There is, however, one special domain that is called *Dom0* which is
where the Desktop Manager (currently KDE) runs, and this is where you
log into. This domain doesn't have any networking connectivity and is
essentially only dedicated for running the Window and Desktop Manager,
nothing else. Specifically all the user applications run in AppVMs,
never in Dom0.

Qubes Manager and command line tools
------------------------------------

All aspects of the Qubes system can be controlled using the command line
tools run under a Dom0 console. To open a console window in Dom0, one
can e.g. choose Start->System Tools->Konsole, or alternatively press
Alt-F2 and type in ``konsole``.

Various command-line tools are described as part of this user's guide,
and the whole reference can be found `here </wiki/DomZeroTools>`__.

Alternatively one can use a rather intuitive GUI tool called Qubes
Manager. It supports most of the functionality that command line tools
provide. Qubes Manager window can be opened by either clicking on the
"Qubes" icon in the tray (right bottom corner of the screen), or by
choosing Start->System Tools->Qubes Manager from the "Start menu".

Starting apps in domains
------------------------

There are two way to start an app: using the short-cut icons from the
Desktop Manager's menu, or from the command line (from console running
in Dom).

You can start apps directly from the KDE menu. Each domain has its own
menu directory called *Domain: <name>*, that is reachable via
Start->Applications menu. When you enter into this directory, you can
select a specific application that you would like to start:

"r2b1-appsmenu-3.png" attached to GettingStarted|

Note that the menus contain only a few short-cuts, if you would like to
be able to start more apps via menu (e.g. if you install new app), you
would need to add more short-cuts manually. In order to do that you
should righ-click on the "Start" button and choose "Menu Editor". Then
choose the domain directory where you want the menu to appear, choose
"New Item", enter its name as '<domain name>: <app name>' and provide
command line for starting the app (see below). Then choose "Save" and
wait some 15 sec for the changes to propagate to the KDE menu.

If you would like to start apps from the console, you just need to type:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-run -a <domain> "<app name> [arguments]"

e.g.:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-run -a red firefox

Adding/Removing/Lising domains
------------------------------

You can easily add/remove domains by clicking buttons in the Qubes
Manager.

You can also create/remove/list domains from command line (console under
Dom0) using the following tools:

-  ``qvm-create``
-  ``qvm-remove``
-  ``qvm-ls``

The ``qvm-create`` is a more powerful way of creating domains than the
"Add" button in the Qubes Manager, because it allows you to pass a few
special options that allow to create special types of domains, such as
e.g. a **Standalone VM** (that is not based on a Template) or **NetVMs**
or **ProxyVMs** -- you can read more on this in other chapters of this
guide.

How many domains do I need?
---------------------------

So, how many and what domains do I need? That's a great question, but
there is no good answer that would fit all. This all depends on how does
your digital life look like, what type of job you do, etc.

For start it's reasonable to try the three domains created automatically
by the installer (work, personal, red). Then, when you start feeling
that some things/activities just don't fit, you can easily create a new
domain for them. You will be able to easily copy files to the newly
created domains, as it is covered in one of the `next
chapters </wiki/CopyingFiles>`__ of this guide.

For more paranoid people, it might be worth checking `​this
article <http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/03/partitioning-my-digital-life-into.html>`__
that describes how one of the Qubes authors partitions her digital life
into security domains.
