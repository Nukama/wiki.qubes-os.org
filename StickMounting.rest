In Qubes Beta 3 a new tool, ````\ ``qvm-block``\ ```` has been
introduced that makes mounting USB devices to any user AppVM very easy,
no matter which actual VM is handling the USB controller (those can be
assigned using the `qvm-pci command </wiki/AssigningDevices>`__).

In order to assign a USB disk to a VM, follow these steps:

#. Insert your USB stick.

2. In Dom0 konsole (running as normal user) do:

   .. code:: wiki

       qvm-block -l

    This will list available block devices connected to any USB
    controller in your system, no matter in which VM this controller is
    hosted. The name of the VM hosting the USB controller is displayed
    before the colon in the device name. The string after the colon is
    the name of the device used within the VM.

3. Connect the device, e.g.:

   .. code:: wiki

       qvm-block -a dom0:sda personal

    This will attach the device as "/dev/xvdi" in VM.

3. Open Nautilus file manager in the AppVM. Your stick should be visible
   in the "Places" panel on the left. Just click on the device.

4. When you finish using your USB stick, right-click its icon in Dolphin
   and chose "Safely Remove <Your stick name>".

5. Back to Dom0 konsole -- in order to unmount the stick do the
   following:

.. code:: wiki

    qvm-block -d <device> <vmname>

6. You can remove the device.

    In the next release this will get integrated into the Qubes GUI
    manager...
