Upgrading Qubes R2 Beta 3 to R2 rc1
===================================

Current Qubes R2 Beta 3 (R2B3) systems can be upgraded in-place to the
latest R2 rc1 (R2rc1) release by following the procedure below.

**Before attempting either an in-place upgrade or a clean installation,
we strongly recommend that users back up the system by using the
built-in `backup tool </wiki/BackupRestore>`__.**

Upgrade Template and Standalone VM(s)
-------------------------------------

By default, in Qubes R2, there is only one Template VM, however users
are free to create more Template VMs for special purposes, as well as
Standalone VMs. More information on using multiple Template VMs, as well
as Standalone VMs, can be found `here </wiki/SoftwareUpdateVM>`__.

Qubes R2 rc1 comes with new template based on Fedora 20. You can upgrade
existing template according to procedure described
`here </wiki/FedoraTemplateUpgrade>`__. While technically it is possible
to use old Fedora 18 template on R2 rc1, it is strongly recommended to
upgrade all the Template VMs and Standalone VMs, because Fedora 18 no
longer receive security updates.

Upgrading dom0
--------------

Note that dom0 in R2rc1 is based on Fedora 20, in contrast to Fedora 18
in previous release, so this operation will upgrade a lot of packages.

#. Open terminal in Dom0. E.g. Start->System Settings->Konsole.

2. Install all the updates for Dom0:

   .. code:: wiki

       sudo qubes-dom0-update

After this step you should have ``qubes-release-2-5`` in your Dom0.
Important: if you happen to have ``qubes-release-2-6*`` then you should
downgrade to ``qubes-release-2-5``! The ``qubes-release-2-6*`` packages
have been uploaded to the testing repos and were kept there for a few
hours, until we realized they bring incorrect repo definitions and so we
removed them and also have changed the update procedure a bit
(simplifying it).

3. Upgrade dom0 to R2 rc1:

Note: be sure that the VM used as a update-downloading-vm (by default
its the firewallvm based on the default template) has been updated to
the latest qubes packages, specifically ``qubes-core-vm`` version >=
2.1.31.

.. code:: wiki

    sudo qubes-dom0-update qubes-dom0-dist-upgrade
    sudo qubes-dom0-update

4. If above step completed successfully you should have
   ``qubes-release-2-8`` or later. If not, repeat above step with
   additional ``--clean`` option.

5. Reboot the system.

Please note that if you use Anti Evil Maid, then it won't be able to
unseal the passphrase this time, because the Xen, kernel, and initramfs
binaries have changed. Once the system boots up again, you could reseal
your Anti Evil Maid's passphrase to the new configuration. Please
consult Anti Evil Maid documentation for explanation on how to do that.
