<h1 id="AssigningDevicestoVMs">Assigning Devices to VMs</h1>
<p>In order to assign a whole PCI(e) device to a VM, one should use <code>qvm-pci</code> tool. E.g.</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>lspci</code></pre>
<p>Find the BDF address of the device you want to assign, and then:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>qvm-pci -a &lt;vmname&gt; &lt;bdf&gt;</code></pre>
<p>E.g. assuming 00:1a.0 is a BDF of the device I want to assign to the &quot;personal&quot; domain:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>qvm-pci -a personal 00:1a.0</code></pre>
<p>Note that one can only assign full PCI or PCI Express devices. This means one cannot assign single USB devices -- only the whole USB controller with whatever USB devices connected to it. This limit is imposed by PC and VT-d architecture.</p>

<h2 id="FindingtherightUSBcontroller">Finding the right USB controller</h2>
<p>If you want assign certain USB device to a VM (by attaching a whole USB controller), you need to figure out which PCI device is the right controller. First check to which USB bus the device is connected:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>lsusb</code></pre>
<p>For example I want assign a broadband modem to the netvm. In lsusb output it can be listed as something like this (in this case device isn't fully identified):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>Bus 003 Device 003: ID 413c:818d Dell Computer Corp.</code></pre>
<p>The device is connected to the USB bus #3. Then check which other devices are connected to the same bus - all of them will be assigned to the same VM. Now is the time to find right USB controller:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>readlink /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3</code></pre>
<p>This should output something like:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>../../../devices/pci-0/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3</code></pre>
<p>Now you see BDF address in the path (right before final usb3). Strip leading &quot;0000:&quot; and pass the rest to qvm-pci tool:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>qvm-pci -a netvm 00:1a.0</code></pre>
<h2 id="Possibleissues">Possible issues</h2>
<p>VMs with assigned PCI devices in Qubes have allocated a small buffer for DMA operations (called swiotlb). By default it is 2MB, but some devices need a larger buffer. To change this allocation, edit VM's kernel parameters (this is expressed in 512B chunks):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code># qvm-prefs netvm |grep kernelopts
kernelopts       : iommu=soft swiotlb=2048 (default)
# qvm-prefs -s netvm kernelopts &quot;iommu=soft swiotlb=4096&quot;</code></pre>
