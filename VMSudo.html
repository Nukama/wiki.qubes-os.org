<p>Background (<a href="http://git.qubes-os.org/?p=qubes-r2/core-agent-linux.git;a=blob;f=misc/qubes.sudoers;hb=HEAD">â€‹/etc/sudoers.d/qubes</a> in VM):</p>

# WTF?! Have you lost your mind?!
#
# In Qubes VMs there is no point in isolating the root account from
# the user account. This is because all the user data are already
# accessible from the user account, so there is no direct benefit for
# the attacker if she could escalate to root (there is even no benefit
# in trying to install some persistent rootkits, as the VM&#39;s root
# filesystem modifications are lost upon each start of a VM).
#
# One might argue that some hypothetical attacks against the
# hypervisor or the few daemons/backends in Dom0 (so VM escape
# attacks) most likely would require root access in the VM to trigger
# the attack.
#
# That&#39;s true, but mere existence of such a bug in the hypervisor or
# Dom0 that could be exploited by a malicious VM, no matter whether
# requiring user, root, or even kernel access in the VM, would be
# FATAL. In such situation (if there was such a bug in Xen) there
# really is no comforting that: &quot;oh, but the mitigating factor was
# that the attacker needed root in VM!&quot; We&#39;re not M$, and we&#39;re not
# gonna BS our users that there are mitigating factors in that case,
# and for sure, root/user isolation is not a mitigating factor.
#
# Because, really, if somebody could find and exploit a bug in the Xen
# hypervisor -- so far there have been only one (!) publicly disclosed
# exploitable bug in the Xen hypervisor from a VM, found in 2008,
# incidentally by one of the Qubes developers (RW) -- then it would be
# highly unlikely if that person couldn&#39;t also found a user-to-root
# escalation in VM (which as we know from history of UNIX/Linux
# happens all the time).
#
# At the same time allowing for easy user-to-root escalation in a VM
# is simply convenient for users, especially for update installation.
#
# Currently this still doesn&#39;t work as expected, because some idotic
# piece of software called PolKit uses own set of policies. We&#39;re
# planning to address this in Beta 2. (Why PolKit is an idiocy? Do a
# simple experiment: start &#39;xinput test&#39; in one xterm, running as
# user, then open some app that uses PolKit and asks for root
# password, e.g.  gpk-update-viewer -- observe how all the keystrokes
# with root password you enter into the &quot;secure&quot; PolKit dialog box can
# be seen by the xinput program...)

<p>While ITL still supports above statement, some Qubes users want to enable user/root isolation in VM anyway. We do not support it in any our package, but of course nothing can stop the user from making some modifications in own system.</p>
<p>Below is a complete list of configuration made according to the above statement, with (not necessary complete) list of mechanisms depending on each of them:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>sudo (/etc/sudoers.d/qubes):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
(...)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>easy user-&gt;root access (main option for the user)</li>
<li>qvm-usb (not really working, as of R2)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>PolicyKit (/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/00-qubes-allow-all.rules):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>//allow any action, detailed reasoning in sudoers.d/qubes
polkit.addRule(function(action,subject) { return polkit.Result.YES; });</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>NetworkManager configuration from normal user (nm-applet)</li>
<li>updates installation (gpk-update-viewer)</li>
<li>user can use pkexec just like sudo Note: above is needed mostly because Qubes user GUI session isn't treated by <a href="/wiki/wiki/PolicyKit">PolicyKit?</a>/logind as &quot;local&quot; session because of the way in which X server and session is started. Perhaps we will address this issue in the future, but this is really low priority. Patches welcomed anyway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Empty root password
<ul>
<li>used for access to 'root' account from text console (xl console) - the only way to access the VM when GUI isn't working</li>
<li>can be used for easy 'su -' from user to root</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Dom0password-lesssudo">Dom0 password-less sudo</h2>
<p>There is also password-less user-&gt;root access in dom0. As stated in comment in sudo configuration there (different one than VMs one), there is really no point in user/root isolation, because all the user data (and VM management interface) is already accessible from dom0 user level, so there is nothing more to get from dom0 root account.</p>
