Hardware Compatibility List for Qubes OS
========================================

The following is a list of systems that have been tested and seem to
work fine with Qubes OS (or mostly fine). Unless otherwise noted, all
the systems have support for Intel VT-d, which is needed to properly
secure driver domains in Qubes OS (netvm, usbvm, etc). Systems without
VT-d are still usable, but you don't get an extra protection from driver
domain separation (you still get lots of security benefit from AppVM
separation though).

Systems tested by Qubes core developers
---------------------------------------

-  Lenovo Thinkpad T420 w/ Intel graphics
-  Lenovo Thinkpad T420s w/ Intel graphics (requires 2.3.7 kernel to
   handle the panel screen correctly)

-  Sony Vaio Z 12 -- works well, but some `tinkering
   required </wiki/SonyVaioTinkering>`__
