Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for All Qubes OS Releases
===========================================================

**Note:** The HCL is a compilation of reports generated and submitted by
users. Except in the case of developer-reported entries, the Qubes team
has not independently verified the accuracy of these reports. If using
the list to make a purchasing decision, we recommend that you first test
the hardware yourself, if possible.

**Legend**

**Background colors**

White

We have not received any report jet

Green

The reporter has sent an HCL Info output which indicates everything is
OK.

Yellow

Some non-required feature is missing (e.g., VT-d), or manual tweaking is
required in order to get some components to work.

Red

Some primary feature is not working. These are usually machines with
poor or nonexistent Linux support in general.

**Marks**

OK

The feature is working correctly.

X

The feature does not work or is not present.

\*

An asterisk (\*) indicates that some kind of tweaking is needed.

Generating and Submitting New Reports
-------------------------------------

In order to generate an HCL report in Qubes, simply open a terminal in
dom0 and run ``qubes-hcl-report <vm-name>``, where ``<vm-name>`` is the
name of the VM to which the generated HCL files will be saved. (Note: If
you are working with a new Qubes installation, you may need to update
your system in order to download this script.)

Users are encouraged to submit their HCL reports for the benefit of
further Qubes development and other users. If you would like to submit
your HCL report, please send the **HCL Info** ``.txt`` file to
``qubes-users@googlegroups.com`` (see `here </wiki/QubesLists>`__
information about the mailing lists) with the subject
``HCL - <your machine model name>``. Please include any useful
information about any Qubes features you may have tested (see the legend
above), as well as general machine compatibility (video, networking,
sleep, etc.). If you have problems with your hardware, please send the
**HCL Support Files** ``.cpio.gz`` file as well.

**Please note:** The **HCL Support Files** may contain numerous hardware
details, including serial numbers. If, for privacy or security reasons,
you do not wish to make this information public, please **do not** send
the ``.cpio.gz`` file to the public mailing list.
