Starting applications from different domains (AppVMs) is very easy.

In this example, the word processor runs in the “work” domain, which has
been assigned “green” label, and is fully isolated from other domains,
such as the “untrusted” domain (assigned the “red” label -- “Watch
out!”, “Danger!”) used for random Web browsing, news reading, as well as
from the "work-web" domain, assigned "yellow" label, used for some
work-related Web browsing, not very security critical though. Apps from
different domains run in different AppVMs and have different X servers,
filesystems, etc. Notice the different color frames (labels), and VM
names in the titlebar -- these are drawn by the trusted Window Manager
running in Dom0 and apps running in domains cannot fake them:

And here's just a few more examples:

On the last screenshot we can see Xfce4.10 Window Manager running in
Dom0 (instead of KDE as on previous screens) -- we support customized
Xfce4 in Qubes Dom0 since R2 Beta 2!

It is always clearly visible to which domain a given window belongs.
Here it’s immediately clear that the passphrase-prompting window belongs
to some domain with “green” label. Then, when we look at the titlebar,
we see “[work]”, which is the name of the actual domain. Theoretically,
the untrusted application (here, the “red” Firefox) beneath the prompt
window could draw a similarly looking window within its contents. In
practice this would be very hard, because it doesn’t know e.g. the exact
decoration style that is in use. However, if that is a concern, the user
can simply try to move the more trusted window onto some empty space on
the desktop, i.e. so that no other window was present beneath it. Or,
better yet use the Expose-like effect (available via a hot-key). A
malicious application from untrusted domain cannot spoof the whole
desktop, because the trusted Window Manager will never let any domain to
“own” the whole screen -- its titlebar will always be visible.

Qubes is all about seamless integration from the user’s point of view --
here you can see how it virtualizes tray icons from other domains.
Notice the network icon in a red frame. This icon is in fact managed by
the Network Manager running in a separate NetVM. The notes icon (with
green frame around) has been drawn by the note-taking app running in the
work domain (that gas green label).

All the networking runs in a special, unprivileged NetVM (notice the red
frame around the `NetworkManager? </wiki/NetworkManager>`__ dialog box
on the screen above). Thanks to this, a potential compromise of your
network card driver, or `WiFi? </wiki/WiFi>`__ stack, or DHCP client,
would not affect the integrity of the rest of the system! This feature
requires Intel VT-d or AMD IOMMU hardware (e.g. Core i5/i7 systems).

Qubes lets you update all the software in all the domains all at once,
in a centralized way. This is possible thanks to Qubes unique Template
VM technology. Note that one doesn’t need to shutdown other VMs
(domains) for the update process. This can be done later, in a
convenient moment, and separately per each VM.

Qubes supports secure copy-and-paste operations between AppVMs. Only the
user can initiate a copy and paste operation using a special key
combination (Ctrl-Shift-C/V). Other AppVMs have no access to the
clipboard buffer, so they cannot steal data from the clipboard. Only the
user decides which AppVM should be given access to the clipboard (this
is done by selecting the destination AppVM’s window and pressing
Ctrl-Shift-V combination).

Qubes also supports secure file copying between AppVMs.

Qubes provides a dedicated firewall that itself runs in an isolated
FirewallVM.
