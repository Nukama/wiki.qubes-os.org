With Qubes, it's easy to back up and restore your whole system, as well
as to migrate between two physical machines.

As of Qubes R2B3, these functions are integrated into the Qubes VM
Manager GUI. There are also two command-line tools available which
perform the same functions: `qvm-backup </wiki/Dom0Tools/QvmBackup>`__
and `qvm-backup-restore </wiki/Dom0Tools/QvmBackupRestore>`__.

Creating a Backup
-----------------

#. In **Qubes VM Manager**, click **System** on the menu bar, then click
   **Backup VMs** in the dropdown list. This brings up the **Qubes
   Backup VMs** window.

2. Move the AppVMs which you desire to back up to the right-hand
   **Selected** column. AppVMs in the left-hand **Available** column
   will not be backed up.

    **Note:** An AppVM must be shut down in order to be backed up.
    Currently running AppVMs appear in red.

    Once you have selected all desired AppVMs, click **Next**.

3. Select the destination for the backup:

-  If you wish to send your backup to a `USB mass storage
   device </wiki/StickMounting>`__, select the device in the dropdown
   box next to **Device**.
-  If you wish to send your backup to a (currently running) AppVM,
   select the AppVM in the dropdown box next to **Target AppVM**.

    You must also specify a directory on the device or in the AppVM as a
    destination for your backup. For example, if you wish to send your
    backup to a the ``~/backups`` folder in the target AppVM, you would
    simply type ``backups`` in this field. This destination directory
    must already exist. If it does not exist, you must create it
    manually prior to backing up.

    At this point, you must also choose whether to encrypt your backup
    by checking or unchecking the **Encrypt backup** box.

    **Note:** It is strongly recommended that you encrypt all backups
    which will be sent to untrusted destinations!

    **Note:** The supplied passphrase is used for **both**
    encryption/decryption and integrity verification. If you decide not
    to encrypt your backup (by unchecking the **Encrypt backup** box),
    the passphrase you supply will be used **only** for integrity
    verification. If you supply a passphrase but do not check the
    **Encrypt backup** box, your backup will **not** be encrypted!

4. When you are ready, click **Next**. Qubes will proceed to create your
   backup. Once the progress bar has completed, you may click
   **Finish**.

Restoring from a Backup
-----------------------

#. In **Qubes VM Manager**, click **System** on the menu bar, then click
   **Restore VMs from backup** in the dropdown list. This brings up the
   **Qubes Restore VMs** window.

2. Select the source location of the backup to be restored:

-  If your backup is located on a `USB mass storage
   device </wiki/StickMounting>`__, select the device in the dropdown
   box next to **Device**.
-  If your backup is located on a (currently running) AppVM, select the
   AppVM in the dropdown box next to **AppVM**.

    You must also specify the directory in which the backup resides. If
    you followed the instructions in the previous section, "Creating a
    Backup," then your backup is most likely in the location you chose
    as the destination in step 3. For example, if you had chosen the
    ``~/backups`` directory of an AppVM as your destination in step 3,
    you would now select the same AppVM and again type ``backups`` into
    the **Backup directory** field.

    **Note:** After you have typed the directory location of the backup
    in the **Backup directory** field, click the elipsis button (...) to
    the right of the field.

3. There are three options you may select when restoring from a backup:

   #. **ignore missing**: If any of the AppVMs in your backup depended
      upon a NetVM, ProxyVM, or TemplateVM which is not present in
      (i.e., "missing from") the current system, checking this box will
      ignore the fact that they are missing and restore the AppVMs
      anyway.
   #. **ignore username mismatch**: This option applies only to the
      restoration of dom0's home directory. If your backup was created
      on a Qubes system which had a different dom0 username than the
      dom0 username of the current system, then checking this box will
      ignore the mismatch between the two usernames and proceed to
      restore the home directory anyway.
   #. **skip dom0**: If this box is checked, dom0's home directory will
      not be restored from your backup.

4. If your backup is encrypted, you must check the **Encrypted backup**
   box. If a passphrase was supplied during the creation of your backup
   (regardless of whether it is encrypted), then you must supply it
   here.

    **Note:** The passphrase which was supplied when the backup was
    created was used for **both** encryption/decryption and integrity
    verification. If the backup was not encrypted, the supplied
    passphrase is used only for integrity verification.

    **Note:** An AppVM cannot be restored from a backup if an AppVM with
    the same name already exists on the current system. You must first
    remove or change the name of any AppVM with the same name in order
    to restore such an AppVM.

5. When you are ready, click **Next**. Qubes will proceed to restore
   from your backup. Once the progress bar has completed, you may click
   **Finish**.

Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes
---------------------------------------

The Qubes backup system was been designed with emergency disaster
recovery in mind. No special Qubes-specific tools are required to access
data backed up by Qubes. In the event a Qubes system is unavailable, you
can access your data on any GNU/Linux system with the following
procedure.

#. Untar the main backup file.

   .. code:: wiki

       [user@restore ~]$ cd backups
       [user@restore backups]$ tar -i -xvf qubes-backup-2013-12-26-123456
       qubes.xml.000
       qubes.xml.000.hmac
       vm1/private.img.000
       vm1/private.img.000.hmac
       vm1/icon.png.000
       vm1/icon.png.000.hmac
       vm1/firewall.xml.000
       vm1/firewall.xml.000.hmac
       vm1/whitelisted-appmenus.list.000
       vm1/whitelisted-appmenus.list.000.hmac
       dom0-home/dom0user.000
       dom0-home/dom0user.000.hmac

2. Verify the integrity of the ``private.img`` file which houses your
   data.

   .. code:: wiki

       [user@restore backups]$ openssl dgst -hmac "your_passphrase" vm1/private.img.000
       HMAC-SHA1(vm1/private.img.000)= 0d5855222a697d0568cf97792318fe53fe963a05
       [user@restore backups]$ cat vm1/private.img.000.hmac 
       (stdin)= 0d5855222a697d0568cf97792318fe53fe963a05

    **Note:** The hash values should match. If they do not match, then
    the backup file may have been tampered with, or there may have been
    a storage error.

3. Decrypt the ``private.img`` file.

   .. code:: wiki

       [user@restore ~]$ cd vm1
       [user@restore vm1]$ openssl enc -d -pass pass:your_passphrase -aes-256-cbc -in private.img.000 -out private.img.dec.000

    **Note:** For multi-part files, a loop can be used:

    .. code:: wiki

        for f in private.img.*; do
          openssl enc -d -pass pass:your_passphrase -aes-256-cbc -in $f -out
        ${f/.img/.img.dec}
        done

    **Note:** If your backup was encrypted with a cipher other than
    ``aes-256-cbc``, you must replace it with the correct cipher
    command. Available ciphers commands can be found with
    ``openssl --help``.

4. Untar the decrypted ``private.img`` file.

   .. code:: wiki

       [user@restore vm1]$ tar -M -xvf private.img.dec.000
       vm1/private.img

   **Note:** For multi-part files, a script is required:

   #. Create a ``new-volume-script``:

      .. code:: wiki

          #!/bin/sh
          name=`expr $TAR_ARCHIVE : '\(.*\)\..*'`
          suffix=`printf %03d $[ $TAR_VOLUME - 1 ]`
          echo $name.$suffix >&$TAR_FD

   #. ``chmod +x new-volume-script``.
   #. ``tar --new-volume-script=./new-volume-script -xvf private.img.dec.000``.
      (The ``--new-volume-script`` option enables multi-volume
      untaring.)

5. Mount the private.img file and access your data.

   .. code:: wiki

       [user@restore vm1]$ cd vm1
       [user@restore vm1]$ sudo mkdir /mnt/recovered-image
       [user@restore vm1]$ sudo mount -o loop private.img /mnt/recovered-image
       [user@restore vm1]$ cd
       [user@restore ~]$ cat /mnt/recovered-image/home/user/recovered-data.txt
       This data has been recovered successfully!

Migrating Between Two Physical Machines
---------------------------------------

In order to migrate your Qubes system from one physical machine to
another, simply follow the backup procedure on the old machine, `install
Qubes </wiki/QubesDownloads>`__ on the new machine, and follow the
restoration procedure on the new machine. All of your settings and data
will be preserved!
