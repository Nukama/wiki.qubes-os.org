<p>Yes you can. You can even run a netvm but, of course, you will not benefit from DMA protection for driver domains. So, on a system without VT-d, everything should work the same, but there is no real security benefit of having a separate netvm, as the attacker can always use a simple DMA attack to go from netvm to Dom0.</p>
<p>The above is in theory -- in practice, if you have a broken network card driver and try to run it in a netvm on a system without VT-d, it might crash your system. This might happen e.g. if the driver is not properly using DMA-API.</p>
