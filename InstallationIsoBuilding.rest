How to build Qubes installation ISO
===================================

Qubes uses `FedoraUnity? </wiki/FedoraUnity>`__
`​Revisor <http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/>`__ to build the installation
ISO.

You may want to get familiar with `​Revisor
documentation <http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/documentation>`__.

Build installer packages
------------------------

Get `​Qubes Installer
repository <http://git.qubes-os.org/?p=smoku/installer>`__ and build its
packages:

.. code:: wiki

    cd installer
    make rpms

Packages will be in ``rpm/noarch`` and ``rpm/x86_64``.

Install Revisor
---------------

Next install the freshly built revisor:

.. code:: wiki

    yum install rpm/noarch/revisor*.rpm

Prepare configuration files
---------------------------

All configuration files for Qubes Revisor assume that the working
directory is ``/Devel/Qubes``. So either modify the configuration files
to your needs, or just symlink your working directory as
``/Devel/Qubes``.

See the end of this document for description of the configuration files
purpose.

Create local repository
-----------------------

Revisor fetches all RPM packages from YUM repositories. You will need to
put all additional packages not present in Fedora and Qubes repos (like
the ones you've built in the first step) to local repository. By default
it is ``file:///Devel/Qubes/yum/r1/installer/rpm/``.

Copy or link all ``installer/rpm/*/*.rpm`` packages to
``/evel/Qubes/yum/r1/installer/rpm``. Then create repository metadata.

.. code:: wiki

    mkdir -p /Devel/Qubes/yum/r1/installer/rpm
    cd /Devel/Qubes/installer
    make update-repo
    cd /Devel/Qubes/yum/r1/installer/rpm
    createrepo .

Build ISO
---------

Now you're finally ready to build the ISO image:

.. code:: wiki

    revisor --cli --config=/conf/qubes-install-respin.conf --model=qubes1-x86_64 --install-dvd

and wait...

You may add ``-d 99`` to get a ton of debugging information.

Revisor configuration files
---------------------------

**conf/qubes-install-respin.conf** - Main Revisor configuration file.
This configures Revisor to build Qubes Installation image based on
Fedora 13. All other configuration files and working directories are
pointed here.

**conf/qubes1-x86\_64-respin.conf** - As said Revisor gets all packages
it uses form YUM repositories. This file describes all repositories
needed to build Qubes R1 for x86\_64 architecture. This file also points
the local repository you created before.

**conf/qubes-1-respin.cfg** - Fedora Kickstart formatted file describing
which packages should land in the ISO ``/Packages`` repository. This
describes basically what will be available for installation. The
packages list built using this file will be further filtered by the
comps file.

**conf/comps-qubes1.xml** - Repository Comps file for ISO ``/Packages``
repository, describing packages and package groups of the installer
repository. Package groups are used to select which of the packages are
mandatory to install, which are optional and which are to be just
available on the ISO but not installed by default. Package groups may
also be optional - this allows them to be selected during installation
in Anaconda interface.
