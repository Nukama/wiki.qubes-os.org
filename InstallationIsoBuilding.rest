How to build Qubes installation ISO
===================================

Qubes uses `FedoraUnity? </wiki/FedoraUnity>`__
`​Revisor <http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/>`__ to build the installation
ISO.

You may want to get familiar with `​Revisor
documentation <http://revisor.fedoraunity.org/documentation>`__.

Build installer packages
------------------------

Get `​Qubes Installer
repository <http://git.qubes-os.org/?p=smoku/installer>`__ and build its
packages:

.. code:: wiki

    cd installer
    make rpms

Packages will be in ``rpm/noarch`` and ``rpm/x86_64``.

Install Revisor
---------------

Next install the freshly built revisor and anaconda:

.. code:: wiki

    yum install rpm/noarch/revisor*.rpm
    yum install rpm/x86_64/anaconda*.rpm

Review configuration files
--------------------------

All configuration files for Qubes Revisor are kept in the
````\ ``conf/``\ ```` directory:

-  ````\ ``conf/qubes-install-respin.conf``\ ```` - Main Revisor
   configuration file. This configures Revisor to build Qubes
   Installation image based on Fedora 13. All other configuration files
   and working directories are pointed here.

-  ````\ ``conf/qubes1-x86_64-respin.conf``\ ```` - As said Revisor gets
   all packages it uses form YUM repositories. This file describes all
   repositories needed to build Qubes R1 for x86\_64 architecture. This
   file also points the local repository you created before.

-  ````\ ``conf/qubes-1-respin.cfg``\ ```` - Fedora Kickstart formatted
   file describing which packages should land in the ISO ``/Packages``
   repository. This describes basically what will be available for
   installation. The packages list built using this file will be further
   filtered by the comps file.

-  ````\ ``conf/comps-qubes1.xml``\ ```` - Repository Comps file for ISO
   ``/Packages`` repository, describing packages and package groups of
   the installer repository. Package groups are used to select which of
   the packages are mandatory to install, which are optional and which
   are to be just available on the ISO but not installed by default.
   Package groups may also be optional - this allows them to be selected
   during installation in Anaconda interface.

Create local repository
-----------------------

Revisor fetches all RPM packages from YUM repositories. We currently use
5 repositories:

-  ````\ ``build/yum/installer``\ ```` (installer-related rpms)
-  ````\ ``build/yum/qubes-dom0``\ ```` (all the Qubes stuff)
-  ````\ ``build/yum/dom0-updates``\ ```` (for select 3rd party
   packages, e.g. Xorg)
-  ````\ ``build/fedora13-repo``\ ```` (local fedora 13 repo, copy from
   DVD, we don't keep it uder build/yum, because we don't want our
   update script to process it every time)
-  remote fedora repo for extra packages (usually deps for qubes-dom0)

You need to manually copy the Fedora 13 installation DVD contents
(````\ ``Packages/``\ ```` and ````\ ``repodata/``\ ```` directories)
into ````\ ``build/fedora13-repo``\ ````.

Also, you need to copy all the qubes dom0 rpms into
````\ ``build/yum/qubes-dom0/rpm``\ ```` and run the
````\ ``yum/update_repo.sh``\ ```` script afterwards.

In order to fill the ````\ ``build/yum/installer``\ ```` repo one can
just use ````\ ``make update-repo``\ ````.

The ````\ ``build/yum/dom0-updates``\ ```` is to be used for select rpms
that should also be used instead of those from the fedora (loacal and
remote) repos.

Build ISO
---------

Now you're finally ready to build the ISO image:

.. code:: wiki

    make iso

and wait...

You may add ``-d 1`` (or ``-d 99`` if you're a masochist) in the
Makefile at the end of the revisor command to get (a ton of) debugging
information.
