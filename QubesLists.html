<h2 id="GeneralPostingAdvice">General Posting Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Include a precise and informative subject line. This will allow others to easily find your thread in the future and use it as a reference.
<ul>
<li>Example of a bad subject: &quot;Help! Qubes problems!&quot;</li>
<li>Example of a good subject: &quot;R2B2 Installation problem: Apple keyboard not working in installer.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be concise. Do not write an essay. Include only the essential information. Qubes developers are Very Busy People (VBP), and we'd really rather spend our time improving Qubes than reading essays!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not apologize for your English. This is a waste of everyone's time, including your own. If we can't understand you, we will ask you to clarify (or ignore your message if it's a total mess ;).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While we're generally open to hearing suggestions for new features, please note that we already have a pretty well defined <a href="/wiki/trac/roadmap">roadmap</a>, and it's rather unlikely that we will change our schedule in order to accommodate your request. If there's a particular feature you'd like to see in Qubes, a much more effective way to make it happen is to... contribute code to Qubes which implements it! We happily accept such contributions, provided they meet our standards. Please note, however, that it's always a good idea to field a discussion of your idea on the qubes-devel list before putting in a lot of hard work on something that we may not be able or willing to accept.</li>
