Nvidia proprietary driver installation
======================================

The NVIDIA proprietary driver works **much** more stable than nouveau,
so it's good idea to install it.

`RpmForge? </wiki/RpmForge>`__ packages
=======================================

There are rpm packages with all necessary software on rpmforge. The only
package you have to compile is kernel module (but there is ready src.rpm
package).

Download pacakages
------------------

You will need any Fedora 13 system to download and build packages. You
can use Qubes Dom0 for it, but it isn't necessary. To download packages
from rpmforge - add this repository to your yum configuration
(instructions are on their website). After then download packages using
yumdownloader:

.. code:: wiki

    yumdownloader --resolve xorg-x11-drv-nvidia livna-config-display
    yumdownloader --source nvidia-kmod

Build kernel package
--------------------

You will need at least rpmbuild tool, and then you can use it to build
package:

.. code:: wiki

    yum install rpm-build
    rpmbuild --rebuild nvidia-kmod-260.19.36-1.fc13.3.src.rpm

Most likely it will complain about missing dependencies - install it and
rerun rpmbuid. If everything went right, you have now complete packages
with nvidia drivers for Qubes system. Transfer them to dom0 (eg using
USB stick), install and reboot the system.

Manual installation
===================

But this is somehow complicated: First - download it from nvidia.com
site. Here "NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-260.19.44.run" is used. Copy it to
dom0. Every next step is done in dom0.

See `this page </wiki/CopyToDomZero>`__ for instruction on how to
transfer files to Dom0 (where there is normally no networking).

**WARNING**: Nvidia doesn't sign their files. To make it worse, you are
forced to download them over a plaintext connection. This means there
are virtually dozens of possibilities for somebody to modify this file
and provide you with a malicious/backdoored file. You should realize
that installing untrusted files into your Dom0 is really a bad idea.
Perhaps it might be a better idea to just get a new laptop with
integrated Intel GPU? You have been warned, anyway.

Userspace components
--------------------

Install libraries, Xorg driver, configuration utilities. This can by
done by nvidia-installer:

.. code:: wiki

    ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-260.19.44.run --ui=none --no-x-check --keep --no-nouveau-check --no-kernel-module

Kernel module
-------------

You will need:

-  nvidia kernel module sources (left from previous step)
-  kernel-devel package installed
-  gcc, make, etc

This installation must be done manually, because nvidia-installer
refused to install it on Xen kernel. Firstly ensure that kernel-devel
package installed all needed files. This should consists of:

-  */usr/src/kernels/2.6.34.1-12.xenlinux.qubes.x86\_64*
-  */lib/modules/2.6.34.1-12.xenlinux.qubes.x86\_64/build* symlinked to
   the above directory
-  */usr/src/kernels/2.6.34.1-12.xenlinux.qubes.x86\_64/arch/x64/include/mach-xen*
   should be present (if not - take it from kernel sources)

If it is not true - correct it manually. To build kernel module, enter
*NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-260.19.44/kernel* directory and execute:

.. code:: wiki

    make
    IGNORE_XEN_PRESENCE=1 CC="gcc -DNV_VMAP_4_PRESENT -DNV_SIGNAL_STRUCT_RLIM" make -f Makefile.kbuild
    mv /lib/modules/2.6.34.1-12.xenlinux.qubes.x86_64/kernel/drivers/video/nvidia.ko /lib/modules/2.6.34.1-12.xenlinux.qubes.x86_64/extra/

Ignore error while inserting nvidia.ko (at the end of make phase). Now
you should disable nouveau:

.. code:: wiki

    cat /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-disable.conf
    # blacklist isn't enough...
    install nouveau /bin/true

Add *rdblacklist=nouveau* option to /boot/grub/menu.lst (at the end of
line containing *vmlinuz*).

Configure Xorg
--------------

After all, you should configure Xorg to use nvidia driver. You can use
*nvidia-xconfig* or do it manually:

.. code:: wiki

    X -configure
    mv /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    # replace Driver in Device section by "nvidia"

Now you should reboot the system.
