Using Quebes Firewall
=====================

How to edit rules
-----------------

In order to edit rules for a given domain, select this domain in the Qubes Manager and press the "policeman's helmet" button.

See the screenshot [​here](http://www.qubes-os.org/files/screenshots/release-1-beta-1/snapshot25.png).

Note that if you specify a rule by DNS name it will be resolved to IP(s) *at the moment of applying the rules*, and not on the fly for each new connection. This means it will not work for serves using load balancing. More on this in the message quoted below.
