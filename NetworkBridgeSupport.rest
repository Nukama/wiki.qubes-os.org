Network Bridge Support (EXPERIMENTAL and UNSUPPORTED)
=====================================================

The Qubes developpement team does not support bridging the network
interfaces found in NetVM and don't plan to support it at all. Several
reasons for that:

-  Using a bridged VM is almost only necessary for developpers testing
   or working on OSI layer 2 or layer 3 tools (MAC or routing
   protocols). If not for testing, such tools are almost only used
   directly on routers ...).
-  Most of these tools can be anyway used directly inside the NetVM,
   which has direct access to the network card.
-  It is also possible to use a secondary network card plugged into a
   specific development VM.
-  Such a setup could break security features of Qubes such as AppVM
   firewalling.

Now if you really want to work with OSI layer2 / layer 3 tools, that you
don't have a secondary network card, or that you want to completely
expose services of a given AppVM (at your own risk), a bridged setup may
help you.

Qubes manager patch (Qubes R2B3)
--------------------------------

The following patches can be applied to the Qubes Manager GUI in order
to add an option to easily bridge a VM. Use it at your own risk. If the
patch breaks the Qubes Manager, you can try to restore the qubes
packages:

.. code:: wiki

    # qubes-dom-update qubes-core-dom0 qubes-manager
    # yum reinstall qubes-core-dom0
    # yum reinstall qubes-manager

First, retrieve the attachment of this Wifi article in dom0. Then apply
the three patches the following way:

.. code:: wiki

    # patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubes/qubes.py < qubes.py-bridge.diff
    # patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubesmanager/settings.py < settings.py-bridge.diff
    # patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubesmanager/ui_settingsdlg.py < ui_settingsdlg.py-bridge.diff

Finally restart the qubes manager GUI.

A new option is now available in the AppVM Settings to enable set the
NetVM in bridge mode. For a bridged AppVM, you should the select a netvm
instead of a firewall vm, enabled the Bridge option and restart your
AppVM.
