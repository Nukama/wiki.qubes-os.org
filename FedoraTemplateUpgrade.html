<h1 id="UpgradeofFedoratemplate">Upgrade of Fedora template</h1>
<p>This instruction in simplified version of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upgrading_Fedora_using_yum">â€‹official Fedora instruction</a>. Note that only &quot;yum&quot; method will work in Qubes template VM (if you are curious why: mostly because template VM does not have own bootloader).</p>

<p>Commands to run in dom0 console (you can do the same from Qubes Manager):</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>qvm-clone fedora-18-x64 fedora-20-x64
qvm-run -a fedora-20-x64</code></pre>
<p>Commands to run in new fedora-20-x64 template:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>sudo yum --releasever=20 distro-sync
poweroff</code></pre>
<p>If you have installed a lot of software in your template, it may happen that you don't have enough disk space for upgrade. Yum will tell you this just after confirming the operation (before it change anything to your system). In that case you need to provide some &quot;external&quot; place for yum cache (uses about 2GB during upgrade). For example attach virtual disk stored in some file. Prepare the file in dom0:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>truncate -s 5GB /var/tmp/template-upgrade-cache.img
qvm-block -A fedora-20-x64 dom0:/var/tmp/template-upgrade-cache.img</code></pre>
<p>Then use it in template:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdi
sudo mount /dev/xvdi /mnt/removable
sudo yum --releasever=20 --setopt=cachedir=/mnt/removable distro-sync</code></pre>
<p>After upgrade is finished, you can remove /var/tmp/template-upgrade-cache.img file.</p>
