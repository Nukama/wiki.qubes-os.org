<h1 id="NetworkBridgeSupportEXPERIMENTALandUNSUPPORTED">Network Bridge Support (EXPERIMENTAL and UNSUPPORTED)</h1>
<p>The Qubes developpement team does not support bridging the network interfaces found in NetVM and don't plan to support it at all. Several reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a bridged VM is almost only necessary for developpers testing or working on OSI layer 2 or layer 3 tools (MAC or routing protocols). If not for testing, such tools are almost only used directly on routers ...).</li>
<li>Most of these tools can be anyway used directly inside the NetVM, which has direct access to the network card.</li>
<li>It is also possible to use a secondary network card plugged into a specific development VM.</li>
<li>Such a setup could break security features of Qubes such as AppVM firewalling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you really want to work with OSI layer2 / layer 3 tools, that you don't have a secondary network card, or that you want to completely expose services of a given AppVM (at your own risk), a bridged setup may help you.</p>
<h2 id="QubesmanagerpatchQubesR2B3">Qubes manager patch (Qubes R2B3)</h2>
<p>The following patches can be applied to the Qubes Manager GUI in order to add an option to easily bridge a VM. Use it at your own risk. If the patch breaks the Qubes Manager, you can try to restore the qubes packages:</p>
