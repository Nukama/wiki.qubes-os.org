<h1 id="NetworkBridgeSupportEXPERIMENTALandUNSUPPORTED">Network Bridge Support (EXPERIMENTAL and UNSUPPORTED)</h1>
<p>The Qubes developpement team does not support bridging the network interfaces found in NetVM and don't plan to support it at all. Several reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a bridged VM is almost only necessary for developpers testing or working on OSI layer 2 or layer 3 tools (MAC or routing protocols). If not for testing, such tools are almost only used directly on routers ...).</li>
<li>Most of these tools can be anyway used directly inside the NetVM, which has direct access to the network card.</li>
<li>It is also possible to use a secondary network card plugged into a specific development VM.</li>
<li>Such a setup could break security features of Qubes such as AppVM firewalling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you really want to work with OSI layer2 / layer 3 tools, that you don't have a secondary network card, or that you want to completely expose services of a given AppVM (at your own risk), a bridged setup may help you.</p>

<p>The following patches can be applied to the Qubes Manager GUI in order to add an option to easily bridge a VM. Use it at your own risk. If the patch breaks the Qubes Manager, you can try to restore the qubes packages:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code># qubes-dom-update qubes-core-dom0 qubes-manager
# yum reinstall qubes-core-dom0
# yum reinstall qubes-manager</code></pre>
<p>First, retrieve the attachment of this Wifi article in dom0. Then apply the three patches the following way:</p>
<pre class="wiki"><code># patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubes/qubes.py &lt; qubes.py-bridge.diff
# patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubesmanager/settings.py &lt; settings.py-bridge.diff
# patch /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-package/qubesmanager/ui_settingsdlg.py &lt; ui_settingsdlg.py-bridge.diff</code></pre>
<p>Finally restart the qubes manager GUI.</p>
<p>A new option is now available in the AppVM Settings to enable set the NetVM in bridge mode. For a bridged AppVM, you should the select a netvm instead of a firewall vm, enabled the Bridge option and restart your AppVM.</p>
