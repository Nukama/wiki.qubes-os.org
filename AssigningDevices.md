Assigning Devices to VMs
========================

In order to assign a whole PCI(e) device to a VM, one should use `qvm-pci` tool. E.g.

``` {.wiki}
lspci
```

Find the BDF address of the device you want to assign, and then:

``` {.wiki}
qvm-pci -a <vmname> <bdf>
```

E.g. assuming 00:1a.0 is a BDF of the device I want to assign to the "personal" domain:

``` {.wiki}
qvm-pci -a personal 00:1a.0
```

Note that one can only assign full PCI or PCI Express devices. This means one cannot assign single USB devices -- only the whole USB controller with whatever USB devices connected to it. This limit is imposed by PC and VT-d architecture.

Finding the right USB controller
--------------------------------

If you want assign certain USB device to a VM (by attaching a whole USB controller), you need to figure out which PCI device is the right controller. First check to which USB bus the device is connected:

``` {.wiki}
lsusb
```

For example I want assign a broadband modem to the netvm. In lsusb output it can be listed as something like this (in this case device isn't fully identified):

``` {.wiki}
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 413c:818d Dell Computer Corp.
```

The device is connected to the USB bus \#3. Then check which other devices are connected to the same bus - all of them will be assigned to the same VM. Now is the time to find right USB controller:

``` {.wiki}
readlink /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3
```

This should output something like:

``` {.wiki}
../../../devices/pci-0/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb3
```

Now you see BDF address in the path (right before final usb3). Strip leading "0000:" and pass the rest to qvm-pci tool:

``` {.wiki}
qvm-pci -a netvm 00:1a.0
```

Possible issues
---------------

VMs with assigned PCI devices in Qubes have allocated a small buffer for DMA operations (called swiotlb). By default it is 2MB, but some devices need a larger buffer. To change this allocation, edit VM's kernel parameters (this is expressed in 512B chunks):

``` {.wiki}
# qvm-prefs netvm |grep kernelopts
kernelopts       : iommu=soft swiotlb=2048 (default)
# qvm-prefs -s netvm kernelopts "iommu=soft swiotlb=4096"
```

This is [â€‹known to be needed](https://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel/browse_thread/thread/631c4a3a9d1186e3) for Realtek RTL8111DL Gigabit Ethernet Controller.

Bringing PCI device back to dom0
--------------------------------

By default device detached from some VM (or when VM with PCI device attached get shut down) isn't attached back to dom0. This is an intended feature. A device which was previously assigned to a less trusted AppVM could attack dom0 if it were automatically reassigned there. In order to re-enable the device in dom0, either:

1.  Reboot the physical machine.

or

1.  Go to the sysfs (`/sys/bus/pci`), find the right device, detach it from the pciback driver and attach back to the original driver. Replace `<BDF>` with your device, for example `00:1c.2`:

    ``` {.wiki}
    echo 0000:<BDF> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pciback/unbind
    MODALIAS=`cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:<BDF>/modalias`
    MOD=`modprobe -R $MODALIAS | head -n 1`
    echo <BDF> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/$MOD/bind 
    ```
