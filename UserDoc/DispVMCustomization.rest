Customization of Disposable VM
==============================

It is possible to change the settings of each new Disposable VM
(DispVM). This can be done by customizing the DispVM template:

#. Start a terminal in the ``fedora-18-x64-dvm`` TemplateVM by running
   the following command in a dom0 terminal. (By default, this
   TemplateVM is not shown in Qubes VM Manager. However, it can be shown
   by selecting "Show/Hide internal VMs.")

   .. code:: wiki

       qvm-run -a fedora-18-x64-dvm gnome-terminal

#. Change the VM's settings and/or applications, as desired. Note that
   currently Qubes supports exactly on DispVM template, so any changes
   you make here will affect all DispVMs. Some examples of changes you
   may want to make include:

   -  Changing Firefox's default startup settings and homepage.
   -  Changing Nautilus' default file preview settings.
   -  Changing the DispVM's default NetVM. For example, you may wish to
      set the NetVM to "none." Then, whenever you start a new DispVM,
      you can choose your desired ProxyVM manually (by changing the
      newly-started DipsVMs settings). This is useful if you sometimes
      wish to use a DispVM with a TorVM, for example. It is also useful
      if you sometimes wish to open untrusted files in a
      network-disconnected DispVM.

#. Create an empty ``/home/user/.qubes-dispvm-customized`` file:

   .. code:: wiki

       touch /home/user/.qubes-dispvm-customized

#. Shutdown the VM (either by ``poweroff`` from VM terminal, or
   ``qvm-shutdown`` from dom0 terminal).
#. Regenerate the DispVM template:

   .. code:: wiki

       qvm-create-default-dvm --default-template --default-script

**Note:** All of the above requires at least qubes-core-vm >= 2.1.2
installed in template.
