Qubes specific VM config files
==============================

Those files are placed in /rw, which survives VM restart, so can be used
to customize single VM (not all VMs based on the same template).

-  ``/rw/config/rc.local`` - script run at VM startup. Good place to
   change some service settings, replace config files with its copy
   stored in /rw/config etc. Example usage:

   .. code:: wiki

       # Store bluetooth keys in /rw to keep them across VM restarts
       rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth 
       ln -s /rw/config/var-lib-bluetooth /var/lib/bluetooth

-  ``/rw/config/qubes-ip-change-hook`` - script run in NetVM after
   external IP change (or connection to the network)
-  ``/rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script`` - script run in ProxyVM
   after firewall update. Good place to write own custom firewall rules

Note that scripts need to be executable (chmod +x) to be used.
